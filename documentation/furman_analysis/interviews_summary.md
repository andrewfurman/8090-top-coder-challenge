Based on the interviews in INTERVIEWS.md, here's a summary of what ACME Corp employees have observed about their legacy travel reimbursement system:

Key Patterns Identified
Marcus (Sales) - Notices inconsistent reimbursements for similar trips, suspects calendar/timing effects, believes in effort-based rewards, and sees non-linear mileage calculations.

Lisa (Accounting) - Observes a $100/day base per diem with mysterious adjustments, 5-day trip bonuses, tiered mileage rates, diminishing returns on receipts, and receipt amount penalties for very low submissions.

Dave (Marketing) - Experiences seemingly random variations, avoids submitting small receipt amounts, and notices city/timing differences he can't explain.

Jennifer (HR) - Reports fairness complaints, notes new employees get lower reimbursements initially, identifies a 4-6 day "sweet spot" for trip length, and sees department-based variations.

Kevin (Procurement) - The most analytical observer who has tracked 3 years of data and identified:

Optimal efficiency: 180-220 miles/day
Spending thresholds: <$75/day (short), <$120/day (medium), <$90/day (long trips)
Submission timing effects (Tuesday best, avoid Friday)
Lunar cycle correlations (4% better at new moon)
Six different calculation paths based on trip characteristics
"Sweet spot combo": 5 days + 180+ miles/day + <$100/day spending
Common Themes
Base per diem: ~$100/day
Trip length effects: 5-day trips get bonuses, 4-6 days is optimal
Mileage tiers: Non-linear calculation, possibly logarithmic
Receipt penalties: Very low amounts (<$50) often worse than submitting nothing
Efficiency rewards: High miles-per-day ratios get bonuses
Timing effects: End-of-quarter, monthly, and even daily submission timing matters
Spending caps: Diminishing returns on high daily expenses
Possible randomization: Some variation appears intentional to prevent gaming
The employees agree the system is complex, partially opaque, but contains discoverable patterns for those willing to analyze it systematically.
